# Datasheet Template

## Motivation
1.	Purpose: The dataset was created to identify pH-responsive biopolymers suitable for drug delivery systems. The goal was to analyse FTIR spectra to detect the presence of (C=O) of carboxylic acid groups (pKa ~4.8), which indicate pH sensitivity, aiding in the development of pH-dependant pharmaceutical formulations that respond to a targeted pH range (pH ~ 6.2 - 7.8).
2.	Creators: FTIR analyses and the dataset was created by Malaz Abdelsadig during PhD research project (2017-2023) at the University of Huddersfield (UK). This research, titled “Investigation of Novel pH-Responsive Polysaccharide and Protein-Based Biopolymers for Controlled Drug Release Applications,” was funded by the Vice Chancellor’s Scholarship Award for achieving distinction (received during MSc. Pharmaceutical & Analytical Science degree). Few FTIR spectrums were obtained from relevant scientific literature and libraries such as (FTIR Libraries and figshare, and Thermo Fisher Scientific).
   
## Composition
1.	Instances: The dataset comprises FTIR spectra of various bio/polymers. Each instance represents an FTIR spectrum, which is a unique fingerprint of the interaction between infrared radiation and the polymeric sample.
2.	Quantity: The dataset includes spectra collected from laboratory experiments and few from relevant scientific libraries. The exact number of instances may vary, but it includes a comprehensive collection of spectra necessary for the analysis.
3.	Missing Data: There is no indication of missing data within the dataset. Each spectrum is complete with metadata including sample ID, wavenumbers (cm-1), and intensities (%).
4.	Confidentiality: The dataset does not contain confidential information.
   
## Collection Process
1.	Acquisition: The data was acquired using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection mode (FTIR-ATR). Spectra were collected from laboratory experiments at the University of Huddersfield.
2.	Sampling Strategy: The dataset includes a diverse range of bio/polymers to ensure comprehensive analysis. The sampling strategy focused on obtaining spectra that represent pH-responsive polymers and Inert polymers with variety physicochemical properties.
3.	Time Frame: The data collection spanned the duration of the PhD research project (2017-2023) as part of the investigation of novel polymers, with additional spectra sourced from existing scientific libraries.
   
## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labelling
1.	Preprocessing: The spectra were processed using Omnic spectroscopic software. This involved measuring the absorption of IR radiation within a wavelength range of 400 cm⁻¹ to 4000 cm⁻¹, with samples screened in powder form at a scan rate of 16 and a resolution of 2.
2.	Raw Data: The raw FTIR spectra were saved in addition to the processed data to support future analyses and potential reprocessing.
   
## Uses
1.	Potential Uses: The dataset can be used for various tasks, including the identification of pH-responsive bio/polymers, the development of drug delivery systems, and further research into the structure-function relationships of the investigated materials.
2.	Impact on Future Uses: The dataset’s composition and collection methods ensure its applicability for a wide range of scientific analyses. However, users should be aware of the limitations related to dataset diversity and spectral quality.
3.	Restricted Uses: The dataset should not be used for applications outside the scope of scientific research and development.
